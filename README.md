TypeVim is a plugin built to make object-oriented programming in VimL easier. It
provides helper functions that allow users to define their own types, define
*polymorphic* types, and preserve class invariants within instances of those
types.

I wrote this plugin to cut down on boilerplate in my other plugins.

This is a work in progress.
